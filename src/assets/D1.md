I built a **Spotify Auth-enabled React app using PKCE OAuth2**, deployed on Netlify.
It authenticates a user with Spotify, receives an access token, and allows me to access protected user data like top tracks.

## 1. What is OAuth 2.0?

OAuth 2.0 is a protocol that lets users grant limited access to their data (like Spotify profile, top tracks) **without giving away their password**.

In this case:

* User logs in with **Spotify**
* Spotify sends back an **authorization code**
* App exchanges this code for an **access token**
* This token lets user call Spotify APIs **on behalf of the user**

---

## 2. What is PKCE?

**PKCE** stands for *Proof Key for Code Exchange*.
It's an extension to OAuth 2.0 to make it **secure for frontend-only apps** (i.e. no backend).

Since public frontend apps can't keep secrets safe, PKCE replaces the "client secret" with:

* `code_verifier`: a random string generated and saved by your app
* `code_challenge`: a hashed, encoded version of `code_verifier`

Spotify remembers the `code_challenge` and will **only issue the access token if you provide the correct `code_verifier`** during the exchange.

---

## 3. The Spotify Auth Flow I Used

App uses **Authorization Code Flow with PKCE**, the safest for frontend.

Hereâ€™s the full flow:

```txt
[1] User clicks Login â†’
[2] Redirect to Spotify /authorize â†’
[3] User logs in, grants permissions â†’
[4] Spotify redirects to /callback?code=XYZ â†’
[5] App uses `code` + `code_verifier` to get access_token â†’
[6] Use access_token to fetch user data from Spotify
```

## 4. Step-by-Step Breakdown of What My Code Does

### ðŸ”¹ `login.ts`

1. Generate a random `code_verifier`
2. Store it in `sessionStorage` (temporary for the login session)
3. Hash the `code_verifier` into a `code_challenge`
4. Build Spotify auth URL with:

   * client\_id
   * redirect\_uri
   * scope (data you want access to)
   * code\_challenge
5. Redirect user to Spotify

---

### ðŸ”¹ Spotify Login Page (outside the app)

* User logs in and clicks "Agree"
* Spotify redirects to appâ€™s `/callback?code=XYZ`

---

### ðŸ”¹ `callback.ts`

1. Grab the `code` from URL
2. Read the stored `code_verifier`
3. Send a POST request to Spotify `/api/token` with:

   * `code`
   * `code_verifier`
   * `client_id`
   * `redirect_uri`
4. Spotify verifies the `code_verifier`
5. If valid â†’ returns an **access token**
6. Store token in `sessionStorage`

---

### ðŸ”¹ Now, We Can Fetch Protected Data

We can now:

* Use `access_token` in headers
* Call Spotify endpoints like `/me/top/tracks`

```ts
fetch('https://api.spotify.com/v1/me/top/tracks', {
  headers: {
    Authorization: `Bearer ${access_token}`
  }
})
```

---

## 5. Security: Why PKCE is Safe for Frontend

* You **donâ€™t need** a client secret
* You **donâ€™t expose** anything private
* Even if someone hijacks the `code`, without `code_verifier`, itâ€™s useless

PKCE protects against **man-in-the-middle attacks**, which is why services like Spotify recommend it for SPAs.

---

## 6. Why We Use Netlify Redirects

Netlify doesnâ€™t know how to serve React routes like `/callback`, so we:

* Added a `_redirects` file to serve `index.html` for all paths
* That ensures React handles routing on client-side (SPA behavior)

---

## ðŸ’¬ Summary

We now have a **Spotify-authenticated, fully client-side React app**, secured with PKCE and deployed on Netlify. This is **real-world** OAuth2 experience, and super valuable for my portfolio + interviews.

# MiniSpotify 🎧

> A React + TypeScript project inspired by Spotify’s product UI and architecture.

- Build realistic **music player UI/UX**
- Practice **frontend system design and architecture**
- Understand **audio APIs**, playlist state, and async handling
- Polish a project for **portfolio use** and **top-tier product company interviews**
